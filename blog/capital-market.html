                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The capital market plays a crucial role in the modern economy by facilitating the flow of funds between investors and businesses. It's important to understand the distinction between key terms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capital:</strong> Money that an owner invests in their own business</li>
                    <li><strong>Investment:</strong> Not the same as capital. Investment refers to outsiders' money in a company</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A capital market is where instruments like bonds, debentures, equity, or securities are traded. The primary role of the capital market is to channel investments from investors who have surplus funds to those who are running a deficit or need funding.</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> If XYZ company requires 10 lakh rupees to expand its infrastructure, they might issue company shares or bonds to the market to collect funds from the public who have surplus funds and are willing to be part of XYZ company.</p>

            <section id="meaning">
                <h2>Meaning and Definition</h2>
                <p>The capital market is a market where buyers and sellers engage in the trade of financial securities like bonds, stocks, etc. The buying and selling are undertaken by participants such as individuals and institutions. Generally, this market trades mostly in long-term securities (bonds, stocks, equity shares, preference shares).</p>
                <p>The primary objective of the capital market is to raise long-term funds for companies (it does not deal with short-term financing).</p>
                <p><em>Example:</em> If you have a surplus fund of 50,000 rupees and you keep it in your locker, you'll only have the same amount at the end of the year (which might be affected by the time value of money). However, if you invest that amount in the capital market, it could generate interest or dividends for you. This opportunity is provided by the capital market.</p>
